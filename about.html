      <p>Boatman Express started with one truck and one driver in 1999, and has expanded to a fleet of over 25 trucks and cargo vans operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with over 25 qualified drivers rapidly and reliably answering the freight expediting demands of Middle Tennessee.</p>

      <p>Boatman expedites every kind and size of time-sensitive cargo, from one-box emergency deliveries to trailer-sized loads. Its meteoric growth has come entirely from word-of-mouth referrals by satisfied customers. Founder Randy Boatman and president of the company Chris Sewell attribute their success to two core principles: trust and reliability.</p>

      <p>Boatman can boast an on-time record that beats industry norms. The company prides itself on delivering what it promises, and promising only what it can deliver. From giant corporate clients such as Nissan to local small businesses and freight brokers, Middle Tennessee relies on Boatman Express to get it to the dock on time.</p>

        <h2>What is an Expeditor?</h2>

        <p>A freight expeditor rapidly responds to and safely moves freight that is time-sensitive for any number of reasons. It's an emergency-response system of equipment and drivers on call 365 days a year, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. Boatman Express is an expeditor for any type of freight or cargo, large or small, across town or across the country.</p>

        <h2>Why Use an Expeditor?</h2>

        <p>Freight logistics are complex, especially in time-sensitive industries and situations, and inevitably there are times and places when standard systems break down—for too many reasons to list. A freight expeditor is on-call to respond quickly to such events and keep the cargo moving to its destination, often preventing enormously costly down time for production lines that can be disastrous.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes there’s an emergency need for a one-time local or regional delivery, and big long-haul carriers simply aren’t equipped or geared to respond. An expeditor is standing by with drivers and equipment that can get the job done.</p>

        <p>Some industries run on just-in-time deliveries, and unpredictable fluctuations in demand can catch them in a bind, needing more inventory fast. An expeditor is the best answer.</p>

        <p>Other needs include milk-run routes that supplement regular freight deliveries and drop-offs, where scheduled runs can’t wait for freight that’s coming off the production line soon, or for equipment or components that are tied up, yet need to move from one location to another soon. An expeditor can slide into the “spaces” between regular runs to augment hauling and keep operations moving.</p>

        <p>Carriers also can get overloaded in peak times, and an expeditor can be called in as sort of a temporary "fleet expansion" for those kinds of situations.</p>

        <h2>Who Needs an Expeditor?</h2>

        <p>Rolling freight is the lifeblood of industry. Without it running, and running on time, parts and components don't get to assembly lines, air freight misses flights or deliveries, food doesn't get to market or it spoils, retailers have gaps on their shelves and frustrated customers, personnel stand around while on the clock, medical services are put on hold, and production in any facility can grind to a halt. Any business or industry that has to move anything, in or out, should have the number of an expeditor handy, because chances are, they're going to need one. We'd like to be that expeditor.</p>
