      <p>Boatman Express started with one truck and one driver in 1999, and has expanded to a fleet of over 25 trucks and cargo vans operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with over 25 qualified drivers rapidly and reliably answering the freight expediting demands of Middle Tennessee.</p>

      <p>Boatman expedites every kind and size of time-sensitive cargo, from one-box emergency deliveries to trailer-sized loads. Its meteoric growth has come entirely from word-of-mouth referrals by satisfied customers. Founder Randy Boatman and president of the company Chris Sewell attribute their success to two core principles: trust and reliability.</p>

      <p>Boatman can boast an on-time record that beats industry norms. The company prides itself on delivering what it promises, and promising only what it can deliver. From giant corporate clients such as Nissan to local small businesses and freight brokers, Middle Tennessee relies on Boatman Express to get it to the dock on time.</p>
